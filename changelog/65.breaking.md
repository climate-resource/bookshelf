The `bookshelf` package has been split into two:
* `bookshelf` - the core package for consuming content from the bookshelf
* `bookshelf-producer` - the CLI tool for creating and managing books

This should require no changes for data consumers.
This change makes for a cleaner separation between consuming
and producing datasets.
