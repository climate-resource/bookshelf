  - name: ambition
    description: |
      Used to represent a spread in the interpretation of NDCs due to vague NDC definitions and ambiguous
      expression of commitments or a stated range. All values may be the same if there is no ambiguity in the
      pledged targets.

  - name: conditionality
    description: |
      Denotes the conditionality of a pathway. The international community is expected to provide both
      technological and financial support to assist many lower income developing countries to transition to
      low-emissions economic growth paths therefore only Non-Annex I countries generally have targets that are
      conditional on funding.
    type: string
    allowed_NA: false
    required_column: true
    controlled_vocabulary:
      - value: conditional
        description: |
          A conditional target with higher emissions reductions, subject to achieving international support.
          The conditions and support specified may relate to financial resources, technology transfer,
          technical cooperation, capacity-building support from other countries, the availability of
          market-based mechanisms, or absorptive capacity of forests and other ecosystems. For countries
          without conditional targets, this timeseries will be the same as the 'unconditional' case.
      - value: unconditional
        description: An unconditional target is a target that a country will implement with their own resources.
      - value: range
        description: |
          Min-max range of targets ranging from the highest emission level of the unconditional target to the
          lowest emission level of the full implementation NDC (conditional and unconditional)

      The treatment of pathways where targets lack ambition and exceed a reference
      'no-additional-climate-policy' emissions scenario. The reference scenario depends on the version of the
      dataset that is used.

        description: |
          Total greenhouse gas emissions. This can be referred to either total emissions including LULUCF
          or excluding LULUCF. Refers to category for the details.
  - name: variant
    description: |
      A Variant specifies the sources and parameters used to create an input dataset. Older variant names have
      been translated into the current variant naming scheme as of Feb 2023.
