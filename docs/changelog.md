## bookshelf v0.3.1b3 (2024-10-13)

No significant changes.


## bookshelf v0.3.1b2 (2024-10-13)

No significant changes.


## bookshelf v0.3.1b1 (2024-10-13)

### Breaking Changes

- The `bookshelf` package has been split into two:
  * `bookshelf` - the core package for consuming content from the bookshelf
  * `bookshelf-producer` - the CLI tool for creating and managing books

  This should require no changes for data consumers.
  This change makes for a cleaner separation between consuming
  and producing datasets.

  ([#65](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/65))

### Features

- Added Climate Resource's NDCs dataset to the bookshelf ([#56](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/56))
- Add a functions to add long format data and compressed files ([#58](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/58))
- Add a functions to get long format data from the book ([#59](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/59))
- Added 20240318 version of CAT dataset to the bookshelf ([#64](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/64))

### Improvements

- When running a notebook, the files were verified through data content hash code rather than file name hash code ([#60](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/60))
- Migrate to github ([#106](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/pull/106))

### Bug Fixes

- resolve the issue where the upload and download files have rows in a different order. ([#63](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/63))

### Improved Documentation

- Add example notebooks to docs ([#61](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/61))
- Migrated documentation to use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
  This allows us to write documentation in only MarkDown,
  instead of mixing reStructuredText and Markdown. ([#66](https://github.com/climate-resource/bookshelf/issue/66))
