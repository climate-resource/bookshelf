  - name: conditionality
    description: Denotes the conditionality of a pathway. The international community is expected to provide both technological and financial support to assist many lower income developing countries to transition to low-emissions economic growth paths therefore only Non-Annex I countries generally have targets that are conditional on funding.
    type: string
    allowed_NA: false
    required_column: true
    controlled_vocabulary:
      - value: conditional
        description: A conditional target with higher emissions reductions, subject to achieving international support. The conditions and support specified may relate to financial resources, technology transfer, technical cooperation, capacity-building support from other countries, the availability of market-based mechanisms, or absorptive capacity of forests and other ecosystems. For countries without conditional targets, this timeseries will be the same as the 'unconditional' case.
      - value: unconditional
        description: An unconditional target is a target that a country will implement with their own resources.
      - value: range
        description: Min-max range of targets ranging from the highest emission level of the unconditional target to the lowest emission level of the full implementation NDC (conditional and unconditional)
